# SYNAPSE
Spiking Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning and Genetic Algorithms for an adaptive alien planet exploration robot.

## Real-World Relevance
**This has direct parallels to current and future space exploration:**

- NASA and other space agencies need robots that can adapt to unknown environments
- Energy efficiency is critical in space missions
- Robots must operate autonomously due to communication delays
- Unexpected terrain and conditions require adaptive behavior without human intervention

## Simulation Environment Features
**Variable Planetary Conditions:**

- Different gravity settings (low/high/variable gravity zones)
- Atmospheric effects (wind gusts, visibility changes)
- Temperature variations affecting system performance
- Day/night cycles with changing visibility

**Diverse Alien Terrain Types:**

- Rocky highlands with unstable surfaces
- Viscous liquid areas (shallow alien seas)
- Loose regolith/sand-like surfaces
- Ice fields with low friction
- Steep inclines and descents

**Mission Objectives:**

- Resource detection and sampling
- Mapping unexplored territory
- Navigating back to base for recharging
- Avoiding hazardous zones
- Prioritizing scientific value in limited-energy scenarios
